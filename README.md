# notes-on-diffusers
This is meant to be a public notebook detailing the evolution of diffusion models and techniques across different modalities. For now, this is just my notes. 

Disclaimer: Once a chapter is done, I'll link it below. This is a rough draft of the chapters and will be refined as I start writing them out.

2. DDPM to DDIM - The intution behind the speedup
3. DDIM Inversion

5. Latent Diffusion
6. Stable Diffusion
7. Dalle-2 / UnCLIP
8. Dreambooth
